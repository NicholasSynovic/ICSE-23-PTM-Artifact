# Requirements
<!-- A REQUIREMENTS file for artifacts which focus on software. This file should cover aspects of hardware (e.g., performance, storage or non-commodity peripherals) and software environments (e.g., Docker, VM, and operating system; package dependencies, etc.). Any deviation from standard environments needs to be reasonably justified.

This project utilizes `Python 3.10.4` features.

The `poetry` build system was used to handle setup of virtual environments and building the Python release packages.

Additionally, there is a `requirements.txt` file containing the dependencies.

Shell scripts are written targetting the `bash` shell.

`GNU parallel` is used within shell scripts.
